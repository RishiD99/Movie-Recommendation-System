# Movie Recommendation System

This is a movie recommendation system based on the **MovieLens** dataset. Two approaches are used for recommending movies:

## Approaches

### 1. Popularity-Based Approach
In this approach, a **weighted rating** is calculated using the **Bayesian ratings formula**. The weighted rating is used to recommend movies based on their popularity.

### 2. Content-Based Approach
In the content-based approach, movies are recommended based on their **genre** and **release year**. This method suggests movies that are similar to the ones the user has already interacted with, based on these attributes.

## Dataset
The system is built using the **MovieLens** dataset, which provides a collection of movie ratings and metadata.
